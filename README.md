## How to Play
As a logistics operator, your task is to ensure deliveries are received on time. You'll be expected to manage all aspects of your business, such as:
 * Managing employees
 * Scheduling vehicles for delivery
 * Maintaining your clients' happiness

## Algorithms Used Behind the Scenes:
At the moment I plan on using Dijkstra's and the infamous A* search algorithms to find each vehicles shortest routes to destination.
